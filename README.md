# Weather Forecast Dashboard

# My Goal

The goal of this exercise is to challenge myself to build a working weather application tha tthe user can type in any city and find out the weather of that particular location.

This was one of the very first projects I ever completed. I have been reworking a lot of it to make it more functional.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
WHEN I search for a city I get the five day forecast
```

This is the mock up I was aiming for:
![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta.](./assets/images/06-server-side-apis-homework-demo.png)
